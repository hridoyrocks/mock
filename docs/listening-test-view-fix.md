# Listening Test View Fix - Student Side

## Problem
The student test view for listening section was showing all questions as "fill in the gap" style, regardless of their actual question type.

## Solution
Created a dedicated question render partial that properly handles the 4 allowed question types:

### 1. Created New Partial File
`resources/views/student/test/listening/question-render.blade.php`

This file handles rendering of:
- **Fill in the Blanks** - Shows inline text inputs within the question text
- **Single Choice** - Radio buttons with options
- **Multiple Choice** - Checkboxes for multiple answers
- **Dropdown Selection** - Inline dropdown menus within the question text

### 2. Updated Main Test View
`resources/views/student/test/listening/test.blade.php`

Changed from:
- Long if-elseif-else blocks handling all question types
- Mixed handling of removed question types (matching, form_completion, etc.)

To:
- Clean include statement using the new partial
- Proper question number tracking based on question type

### 3. Question Number Tracking
The system now properly tracks question numbers:
- Fill in the blanks: Counts each blank as a separate question
- Dropdown selection: Counts each dropdown as a separate question  
- Single/Multiple choice: Each question counts as one

## Key Features
1. **Inline Inputs** - Fill in the blanks and dropdowns appear inline within the question text
2. **Proper Styling** - Each question type has appropriate styling
3. **Clean Code** - Separated rendering logic into a partial for maintainability
4. **Backwards Compatible** - Falls back to text input for any unrecognized question types

## Testing
Test each question type in the listening section:
1. Create questions of each type in admin panel
2. Take the test as a student
3. Verify proper rendering of each question type
4. Check that question numbering is correct
5. Submit test and verify answers are saved
