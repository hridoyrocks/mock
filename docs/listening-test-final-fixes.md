# Listening Test View Fixes - Final Update

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Instructions Issue
**Problem**: All instructions were showing at the top together
**Solution**: 
- Instructions now show right before the relevant questions
- Each unique instruction is shown only once
- Instructions maintain proper grouping

### 2. HTML Syntax in Instructions
**Problem**: HTML tags were showing as text in instructions
**Solution**: 
- Changed from `{{ $instruction }}` to `{!! $instruction !!}`
- Now HTML is properly rendered

### 3. Single Choice Not Showing
**Problem**: Single choice questions were not displaying
**Solution**: 
- Combined single_choice and multiple_choice cases
- Added fallback for questions without options
- System now checks correct answer count to determine radio vs checkbox

## Key Changes

### 1. Question Render Partial Update
File: `resources/views/student/test/listening/question-render.blade.php`
- Combined single/multiple choice handling
- Added proper HTML rendering for content
- Improved question numbering display

### 2. Main Test View Update
File: `resources/views/student/test/listening/test.blade.php`
- Instructions now show per question group
- Updated navigation to handle only 4 question types
- Fixed total question counting

### 3. Styling Improvements
- Instructions have proper background and border
- Radio/checkbox inputs properly sized
- Inline inputs (blanks/dropdowns) styled correctly

## How It Works Now

1. **Instructions**: Show right before the questions they apply to
2. **Fill in the Blanks**: Shows inline text inputs with proper numbering
3. **Single Choice**: Shows radio buttons (one answer allowed)
4. **Multiple Choice**: Shows checkboxes (multiple answers allowed)
5. **Dropdown Selection**: Shows inline dropdown menus

## Testing Steps

1. Create questions with HTML content in instructions
2. Create single choice questions and verify radio buttons appear
3. Check that instructions appear in the right place
4. Verify question numbering is correct in navigation
