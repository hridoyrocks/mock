**Database fields:**
- `study_streak_days` - Current streak count

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**If streak not showing:**
1. Check if `study_streak_days` column exists in users table
2. Run migration: `php artisan migrate`
3. Complete a test to trigger streak update

**If target band not calculating:**
1. Ensure user has completed tests with band scores
2. Check if UserGoal exists for user
3. Verify `band_score` is not null in student_attempts table
